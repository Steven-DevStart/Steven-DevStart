## Hello World! 

I like code. It has become an art and form of expression for me. The better I get at coding; makes the process more enjoyable as I am able to progess faster than last time and this feels good. I started my coding journey near my 19th birthday in November 2021. I tried a few html coding tutorials on codecademy, shortly after I signed up for a bootcamp(frontend dev) I did not know what to expect as I was completly new to this. Learning html and css were fine I had a good understanding, but had difficulty with javascript. This is where I am at today in 2023 going into 2024 I am really trying to become a front end developer.
